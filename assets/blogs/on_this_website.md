When I first started designing this webiste, I meant for it to be an experiment on if I could map all (most) of my digital interactions and use them as an indexed digital journal.

I'm discontinuing updates

I'll probably push out some more blogs on here while I build out the social version of Chintamani, but I'm not keen on maintaining this though. To be honest, I've not really spent a lot of time on fixing up the UI. But the code is pretty good tbh, the main file is hardly 200 loc and there's like 10 components in here all together.

I'll probably get back to this, idk.

I've been thinking that I should write more. Little notes to myself, notes on the web, notes to people, notes to strangers and all that.

okay, bye
